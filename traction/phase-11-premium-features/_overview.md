# Phase 11: Revenue & Premium Model (Refined)

> **Philosophy:** "Safety is free. Insurance is premium."
> **Goal:** Sustainable business model without compromising privacy.

## 💎 The Freemium Model

| Feature | Free Plan | Premium (Legacy+) |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Active Vaults** | 3 Vaults | Unlimited |
| **Asset Limit** | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Check-in** | Manual | Manual + Delegated |
| **Encryption** | Standard (1-Key) | **Guardian Sharding (SSS)** |
| **Claiming** | Gas Required | **Gasless (Pre-paid)** |
| **Support** | Community | Priority Email |
| **Price** | **$0** | **$49/yr** or **1 SOL Founder NFT** |

## 🌟 Premium Features

### [11.1 Guardian Key Sharding (SSS)](./11.1-guardian-sharding.md)
**"The Safety Net."**
Split decryption key into 3 shards. Eliminates "Lost Key" anxiety.
> **Zero-Knowledge Note:** We cannot see vault contents. Upsell is triggered by asking user: *"Is this vault worth keeping forever?"* or *"Estimated Value > $10k?"*

### [11.2 Gas Station Network](./11.2-gas-station.md)
**"The Grandma-Proof Claim."**
Owner pre-pays gas. Recipient claims with 0 SOL.
> **Killer USP:** This is the bridge between Crypto and Real World.

## 🚀 Strategy (Hackathon vs Real World)

### 1. The "Psychological Upsell" (ZK-Friendly)
Since we can't see the asset value (ZK), we ask the user during creation:
*   *UI Prompt:* "How vital is this vault?"
    *   **A: Sentimental (Free)** → Proceeds normally.
    *   **B: Life Savings (High Value)** → Prompt: *"For assets >$10k, we recommend Guardian Sharding to ensure 100% recoverability."*

### 2. Pricing Strategy
*   **Hackathon Mode:** "1 SOL Lifetime Founder NFT". Great marketing hook for judges/community funding.
*   **Production Mode:** Peg to USD ($49 USDC/year) to avoid SOL volatility risk.

## 🛠️ Execution Priority
1.  **Gas Station (High Priority):** Must implement for Hackathon. The "Grandma Moment" is the winning demo execution.
2.  **Guardian Sharding (Low Priority):** Frontend simulation/UI mockup only. Too complex for 1-week timeline.
