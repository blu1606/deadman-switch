# 8.4 Hybrid Landing Page (General Audience)

> **Goal:** Pivot messaging from "Crypto Protocol" to "Life Assurance" for non-technical users.  
> **Core Metaphors:** "Life Assurance" (Why) + "Digital Fire Alarm" (How).  
> **Target Audience:** Hybrid (Crypto Natives + Normal People with digital assets).

## 🎯 The "Hybrid" Narrative

We bridge the gap by focusing on **Universal Fears** (loss of access) rather than Technical Features (smart contracts).

| Traditional Crypto | Hybrid Approach |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| "Decentralized Deadman Switch" | "The Digital Emergency Switch" |
| "Smart Contract Vault" | "Automated Safe Deposit Box" |
| "Wallet Connection" | "Secure Login" |
| "Recipient Wallet" | "Beneficiary Access" |

## 📐 UI Structure Refactor

### 1. Hero Section: "Life Assurance" Split
**Concept:** Visualizing the "Before/After" of a crisis.

*   **Headline:** "If you went offline today, would your family know where to look?"
*   **Subhead:** "The automated safety deposit box for your digital life. Crypto, passwords, and final messages—delivered only when you can't."
*   **Visual (Split Screen):**
    *   *Left (The Problem):* Dark, chaotic. Icons of locked laptops, confused family members, "Access Denied" screens.
    *   *Right (The Solution):* Bright, calm. An email notification: *"Dad's Vault: Access Granted"*.
*   **CTA:**
    *   Primary: "Secure My Legacy" (Links to Create).
    *   Secondary: "How it Works" (Scrolls to Switch section).

### 2. The "Emergency Switch" (How it Works)
**Concept:** Explaining the mechanism without jargon.

*   **Metaphor:** "A digital fire alarm."
*   **Flow:**
    1.  **Load the Box:** You deposit assets and notes.
    2.  **Set the Timer:** "If I don't check in for 30 days..."
    3.  **The Heartbeat:** You get a monthly email/ping. You click "I'm OK". Timer resets.
    4.  **The Trigger:** If you don't answer, the box unlocks for your beneficiary.

### 3. Use Case Expansion (Non-Crypto)
Showcase "Normal" assets alongside crypto to broaden appeal.

*   **Card 1: The Portfolio** (Crypto/Stocks)
    *   *"My Ledger is in the safe, seed phrase is..."*
*   **Card 2: The Digital Life** (Passwords/Cloud)
    *   *"Master Password for 1Password is..."*
*   **Card 3: The Goodbye** (Emotional)
    *   *"To my daughter, on your 18th wedding anniversary..."*

## 🛠️ Component Updates

### `src/app/page.tsx` (Hero)
- Replace "Digital Immortality" with "Life Assurance" copy.

### `src/components/landing/ProblemSection.tsx`
- Keep the `$140B Lost` stat but add a "Human" context.
- Add "Google Inactive Account Manager" comparison (We are the Web3 version).

### `src/components/landing/UseCaseGrid.tsx`
- Rename steps to: **Lock** -> **Live** -> **Legacy**.
- Update icons/descriptions to mention "Notes" and "Instructions" heavily, not just "Tokens".
