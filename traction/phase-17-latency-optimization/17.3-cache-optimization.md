# 17.3 Cache & Prefetch Optimization

## 🎯 Goal
Leverage data caching and link prefetching to make page transitions feel instantaneous by having data ready before the user clicks.

---

## 🛠 Proposed Changes

### 1. TanStack Query Configuration
- Set `staleTime` and `gcTime` for vault queries to prevent unnecessary loading states when navigating back and forth.
- Implement "Stale-While-Revalidate" behavior.

### 2. Smart Prefetching
- Optimize `next/link` prefetching.
- Ensure only essential JS bundles are prefetched to avoid bandwidth waste on mobile.

### 3. Persistent Wallet Identity
- Store basic wallet info (truncated address) in `localStorage` to allow the Header to show a "Partial Wallet UI" before full hydration.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Navigating back to Dashboard from a detail page is instant (loads from cache).
- [ ] Background data refresh occurs without disrupting the user.
- [ ] Mobile performance remains high with optimized prefetching.
