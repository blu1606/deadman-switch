# 17.1 Static UI Shell SSR

## 🎯 Goal
Enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for the application's layout and header to eliminate the initial "white screen" and "clunky" mounting phase.

---

## 🛠 Proposed Changes

### 1. Header Decomposition
Presently, the Header is entirely client-side. We need to split it:
- **`HeaderShell` (SSR):** Logo, Main Navigation Links, Background/Blur effects.
- **`HeaderActions` (Client):** Wallet Button, Connectivity Status.
- **Location:** `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`

### 2. Root Layout Cleanup
- Remove `dynamic` import with `{ ssr: false }` for the Header in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- Keep `WalletContextProvider` as dynamic if necessary, but ensure it doesn't block the initial HTML stream.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Header logo and navigation links are visible in the initial HTML source code.
- [ ] No layout shift (CLS) occurs when the Wallet Button hydrates.
- [ ] Direct page refresh (F5) shows the Header instantly.
