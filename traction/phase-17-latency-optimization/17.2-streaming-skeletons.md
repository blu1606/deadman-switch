# 17.2 Streaming & Skeletons

## 🎯 Goal
Implement a Facebook-style loading experience where the page skeleton appears instantly before data is fetched from the Solana blockchain.

---

## 🛠 Proposed Changes

### 1. Global Skeletons
- Create `VaultCardSkeleton` and `StatGridSkeleton` components.
- Use CSS pulse animations for a "premium" feel.
- **Location:** `src/components/ui/skeletons/`

### 2. Route Streaming
- Implement `loading.tsx` in:
    - `src/app/dashboard/`
    - `src/app/claim/`
- These files will render the Skeletons within the layout shell while the `page.tsx` client components are initializing.

### 3. Loading Logic Cleanup
- Remove explicit `if (loading)` spinners from main page components in favor of framework-level `Suspense`.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicking "Dashboard" immediately shows the page shell and card skeletons.
- [ ] Transition from Skeleton to real data is smooth (using CSS transitions).
- [ ] No full-screen blocking spinners are used during page navigation.
