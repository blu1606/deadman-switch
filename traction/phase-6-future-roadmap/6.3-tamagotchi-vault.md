# 6.3 The Tamagotchi Vault (Simplified - v1)

> **Updated:** 2025-12-09
> **Status:** Simplified for Traction phase. No NFTs.

## 🎯 Goal
Turn check-ins into a rewarding game loop by giving the vault a "face" that reacts to its health.

## 👾 Concept (Frontend Only)
Every Vault has a **"Keeper Spirit"** (Kip). Its mood is purely visual, derived from the `time_remaining` vs `total_interval` ratio.

### States
Calculated on the client-side:

| State | Condition | Face |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **Happy** | Time Remaining > 50% | `(• ◡ •)` Glowing |
| **Neutral** | 25% < Time < 50% | `(• . •)` Normal |
| **Worried** | Time < 25% | `(• ~ •)` Shaking |
| **Ghost** | Vault Released | `(× _ ×)` Translucent |

### Mechanics
- **Feed:** `ping()` transaction = "Feed" action. Resets state to **Happy**.
- **No Gas Cost:** purely derived from existing on-chain data (`last_check_in`).
- **Visuals:** Uses the `KeeperSpirit` React component (already built).

## ❌ Deferred features (v2)
- Dynamic NFT minting (Metaplex)
- On-chain streak counter
- Evolution levels

## ✅ Execution Steps
1.  [x] Build `KeeperSpirit.tsx` component (States: Happy, Neutral, Sick, Ghost).
2.  [ ] Integrate into Dashboard Vault Card.
    - Calculate mood based on `vault.lastCheckIn` and `vault.checkInInterval`.
    - Show Spirit next to the countdown timer.
3.  [ ] Add "Feed" animation when clicking Check-in.
